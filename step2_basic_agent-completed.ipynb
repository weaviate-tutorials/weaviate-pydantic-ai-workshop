    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Agents extend LLMs with tools** - Tools let LLMs access real-time data and take actions  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Agents make decisions** - The LLM decides *when* to use tools based on the question  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Context matters** - We can pass user information to personalize agent behavior  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Docstrings are critical** - The agent reads tool docstrings to understand what they do  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Create an agent\n",
    "agent = Agent(model=\"...\", deps_type=YourContextType)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Register tools\n",
    "@agent.tool\n",
    "def your_tool(ctx: RunContext[YourContextType]) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Clear description of what the tool does\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Do something useful\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Run the agent\n",
    "response = agent.run_sync(prompt, deps=context)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Step 3**, we'll add multiple tools and see how the agent intelligently chooses between them - or chooses to use *none* when its own knowledge is sufficient!\n",
    "\n",
